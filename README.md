# fillmyglider
Arduino sketch for a little helper for filling water ballast into a glider.

- switches on two pumps (relay or FET needed)
- while pumping, measures flow rate (hall flow sensor needed)
- while pumping, indicates 10 liter increments with morse code (buzzer needed)
- detects interrupted flow and indicates
- when finished, signalize exact amount pumped with morse code
